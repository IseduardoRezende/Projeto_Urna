# Projeto_Urna
A Electronic Voting System that stores user registrations and votes cast.
# Urna
The project consists of an Electronic Urn and was developed in the following languages: C# and MySQL WorkBench.
It can be used by the school and was developed by me and my group partner LÃ­via Nicole.
We use the Windows Forms(.NET framework) model.
The project was very cool and fun to develop :)
Thank you for your attention.
